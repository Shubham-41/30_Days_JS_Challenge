// Activity 1: Template Literals

// Task 1
// Use template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console.

let Person = {
  name: `Shubham`,
  Age: 22,
};

const msg = `The Person name is ${Person.name} and they are ${Person.Age} Years Old.`;

// Task 2
// Create a multi-line string using template literals and log it to the console.

let MultiLineString = `
MySelf Shubham, 
I am 22 Years Old
I am a Coder 
`;

// Activity 2: Destructuring

// Task 3
// Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers and log them to the console.

let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let [first, second] = arr;

console.log(first, second);

// Task 4
// Use object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object and log them to the console.

let Book = {
  Title: "Summar Story",
  Author: "Shivgemini",
};

// In JavaScript, when destructuring an object, the names must match the keys in the object
let { Title, Author } = Book;

console.log(`Book Title -> ${Title}, Author -> ${Author}`);

// Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators

// Task 5
// Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plus additional elements, and log the new array to the console.

let NewArr = [...arr, 6, 7];

console.log(NewArr);

// Task 6
// Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result.

let result = Sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

console.log(`Sum of first 10 Natural number is ${result}`);

// Activity 4: Default Parameters

// Task 7
// Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter.

  return num1 * num2;

// Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals

// Task 8
// Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, and log the object to the console.

// Object Literal Enhancement :- Object literal enhancement is used to group variables from the global scope and form them into javascript objects. It is the process of restructuring or putting back together.

// Create an object with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console.

// Explanation :- create an object with computed property names. This means that the property names of the object are dynamically generated based on variables or expressions.
